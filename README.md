# ProductPage-loginpage-project

A friend asked for my help with his university final exam project.
He provided me with the design file, and I implemented it into code.

The project consists of:

A simple Product Page that displays product details.

A Login Page for user authentication.
# Product & Login Page - A University Project

This project is a fast-paced implementation of a two-page website, consisting of a product display page and a user login page. The design was provided by a friend for his university final exam, and I was tasked with bringing it to life with code from scratch under a tight deadline.

## 🌟 About The Project

A friend approached me for help with his final university project, providing a design file that needed to be converted into a functional website. The challenge was to deliver a high-quality, pixel-perfect implementation under a tight deadline.

The project consists of two simple, static pages:
1.  **Product Page:** A clean layout to display product details, including an image, title, description, and price.
2.  **Login Page:** A straightforward form for user authentication.

The entire project was built from the ground up in just over an hour, using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
